# Office 365 Plugins for Moodle
*includes support for* **Office 365 Education**, **Office 365 Enterprise** *and* **Active Directory**

This repo is where development on all Office 365 plugins for Moodle takes place. At designated intervals, updated versions of these plugins are pushed to individual repos and updated in the [moodle.org listings](https://moodle.org/plugins).

Currently the following plugins are **actively maintained and required** for new installations and provide the core functionality of the integration:

- [moodle-auth_oidc](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-auth_oidc)
- [moodle-local_o365](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-local_o365)
- [moodle-block_microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-block_microsoft)
- [moodle-repository_office365](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-repository_office365)
- [moodle-filter_oembed](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-filter_oembed)

The plugins below are *not required* for new installations:

- [moodle-block_skypeweb](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-block_skypeweb)
- [moodle-profilefield_oidc](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-profilefield_oidc)
- [moodle-local_msaccount](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-local_msaccount)

The following plugins are "parent" or "shell" plugins which install a *subset* of the above plugins as a collection. They are also *not required* for new installations:
- [moodle-local_office365](https://github.com/Microsoft/moodle-local_office365)

# About this repository
The master branch of this repository contains the most up-to-date code. As issues are completed and new features are added, they are immediately added to master. Master should be fairly stable, however it is the absolute newest code and not intended for production systems. Periodically (about every two weeks), all completed issues are packaged into releases and added to the STABLE branches. You'll find a stable branch for each version of Moodle supported - MOODLE_27_STABLE would be for Moodle 2.7, for example. These branches contain production-ready, stable code.

# Installation
1. The file structure of this repository mimics that of a Moodle install, so the /auth/oidc folder in this repository would go in the /auth/oidc folder of your Moodle install, for example. Place each folder of this repository in your Moodle install according to the folder structure of this repository.
2. From the Moodle Administration block, expand Site Administration and click "Notifications".
3. Follow the on-screen instuctions to install each plugin.
